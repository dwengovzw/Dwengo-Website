Come join the first event on AI & Education in Belgium! It is said that the country will need more educated citizens and workers on these technologies. 
Let's have a conversation with local experts and inspiring initiatives to understand: Who are the key actors in the country? What is needed in and for Belgium? 
How to teach about the technology but also its ethical and legal challenges?
This event will be followed by a meet-and-greet to maybe inspire you to collaborate together! Let's join our forces to bring a high-quality AI education in Belgium.
