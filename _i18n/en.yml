  title1: "Scientific Research"
  title1p1: "Scientists from the Plantentuin Meise and UGent are researching <strong>how trees in the tropical rainforest adapt to climate change</strong>. The stomata on their leaves provide information about the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere during plant growth. Researchers <strong>count</strong> the number of stomata on the leaves and <strong>measure</strong> their size. They then compare the results of recent material with material from a hundred years ago."
  title1p2: "Counting and measuring stomata, however, is a very time-consuming activity. To <strong>automate</strong> this process, a computer scientist from UGent has <strong>trained a neural network</strong>. Training such a network requires many examples: photos of stomata and photos of leaves without stomata."
  title2: "In the Classroom"
  title2p1: "The goal of the KIKS project is to introduce students to the fundamentals of AI and teach them how to understand AI systems they encounter in their daily lives. <br>We encourage teachers to use KIKS and AI in the classroom (see figure), with or without programming.<br>We have tried to make the project as accessible as possible by offering the material online, ensuring that no additional software needs to be installed, and providing the necessary background information through a manual.<br>During the project lessons, we hope that time will be set aside to consider the ethical issues that arise due to the presence of AI and deep learning systems in daily life."
  title2p2: "The teaching material can also be used in other ways. For example, one can choose some notebooks to teach students programming in Python, or extract assignments to work on research competencies in biology, geography, or mathematics classes. Students can become familiar with the principles of digital image processing through some notebooks, or the Dutch or religion teacher can find inspiration for a lesson on the societal aspects of AI in this project."
  subtitle1: "Climate"
  subtitle1p1: "Since the beginning of the industrial revolution (1750), the concentration of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere has increased significantly. This reinforces the natural greenhouse effect. The layer of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere acts like a blanket, which thickens as the amount of greenhouse gases increases. Consequently, it becomes warmer under the blanket because heat has more difficulty escaping from under the blanket into space. The increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere results in an increase in average temperature and global climate change."
  subtitle2: "Stomata"
  subtitle2p1: "Plants are capable of building the energy-rich carbon compounds they need to live, grow, and reproduce. They do this through photosynthesis. For this, the plant must absorb CO2. To enable this absorption, there are microscopic gateways in the leaf epidermis, the stomata. Stomata also contribute to the cooling of the plant and maintain the flow of sap from the roots to high in the plant."
  subtitle2p2: "Paleoclimatology indicates that stomatal size and density are influenced by atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration."
  subtitle3: "AI"
  subtitle3p1: "Deep neural networks are a form of machine learning, and therefore fall within the domain of artificial intelligence. Convolutional neural networks are exceptionally well-suited for recognizing stomata in microphotos."
  subtitle3p2: "Through Python notebooks, we explore step by step this fascinating world. Students gain insight into the fundamentals of artificial intelligence. However, practical aspects such as collecting and preparing the dataset are also involved."

#  socialrobot:
#  intro_title: "Sociale robot"
#  paragraph1: "'Sociale robot' is een vakoverschrijdend STEM-project voor de eerste graad secundair onderwijs. In een aantal modules gaan leerlingen aan de slag om zelf een sociale robot te ontwerpen, te programmeren en te bouwen."
#  paragraph2: "Leerlingen denken na over hoe hun robot zal communiceren en op welke omgevingsfactoren - zoals geluid of beweging - hij zal reageren. Het ontwerpen en grafisch programmeren van de robot doen ze in een simulator. De fysieke robot bouwen ze met herbruikbaar materiaal. Het wordt nog leuker als ze de robot een persoonlijke toets geven. Ze kunnen zich hierin op een creatieve manier uitleven. Gebruikmakend van een microcontrollerplatform, sensoren en actuatoren en hun eigen code voltooien ze hun sociale robot."
#  paragraph3: "Een troef van het KIKS-project is de samenwerking tussen onderzoekers en leerkrachten. Het lesmateriaal van KIKS wordt immers ontwikkeld, parallel met de resultaten van een lopend wetenschappelijk onderzoek aan de UGent en de Plantentuin Meise."
#  title: "Het wetenschappelijk onderzoek"
#  titlep1: "Sociale robotica is een <strong>interdisciplinair domein</strong>, of hoort het te zijn. Een sociale robot interageert immers met zijn omgeving en met de mensen die erin vertoeven."
#  titlep2: "De robot moet efficiënt zijn in het vervullen van zijn taken, maar moet ook aangenaam zijn in omgang. Bij het maken van een robot denkt men best in een interdisciplinair team na over het ontwerp, zowel hardware- als softwarematig. Er is kennis nodig over verschillende domeinen: het gedrag van mensen wanneer ze interageren met een robot, de technische kant van een robot, de esthetiek …"
#  titlep3: "Dankzij <strong>de ontwikkelingen in de robotica en het onderzoek naar de interactie</strong> tussen mens en robot zal er op het vlak van sociale robots meer mogelijk worden in de toekomst. Dankzij <strong>artificiële intelligentie (AI)</strong> kan een robot emoties uit gezichtsuitdrukkingen en stemintonatie afleiden. AI kan ook gebruikt worden om een robot te leren wat sociale interactie is. Helaas zijn er niet altijd voldoende voorbeelden voorhanden van de interactie tussen robots en mensen. Dat betekent dat de vooruitgang die geboekt wordt in het domein van AI, bepalend is voor de vorderingen binnen de sociale robotica."
#  subtitle1: "Sociale robots"
#  subtitle1p1: "Sociale robots zijn niet meer weg te denken uit onze samenleving en worden in uiteenlopende gedaantes ingezet voor verschillende doelgroepen."
#  subtitle1p2: "In de zorgsector worden robots al gebruikt om bejaarden gezelschap te houden en sociaal contact te stimuleren. Voor kinderen zijn er dan weer talloze 'speelmaatjes' op de markt, waar men zich sterk kan aan gaan hechten. Ook gezinnen hebben steeds vaker een personal assistant in huis die taken kan overnemen en door de mogelijke interactie deel wordt van het gezin."
#  subtitle1p3: "In het project is er ruimte voor een discussie over de plaats en (morele) impact van sociale robots in onze maatschappij."
#  subtitle2: "Programmeren met de simulator"
#  subtitle2p1: "Binnen dit project werken de leerlingen met de Dwenguino-simulator, ontworpen voor iedereen die op zoek is naar een eerste (grafische) programmeerervaring."
#  subtitle2p2: "De programmeeromgeving is een uitgebreide vorm van Google Blockly met programmeerblokken die op verschillende abstractieniveaus werden gedefinieerd zodat leerlingen op hun eigen tempo kunnen leren."
#  subtitle2p3: "De leerlingen ontwerpen een robot in de simulator door een aantal bouwblokken te selecteren en op het robotontwerp te slepen. Deze virtuele robot wordt vervolgens aangestuurd door met goedgekozen programmeerblokken een algoritme te ontwerpen en uit te voeren. Dankzij de simulator kan het testen en het debuggen efficiënt verlopen."
#  subtitle2p4: "Nieuwsgierige leerlingen kunnen in de simulator de overeenkomstige tekstuele code ontdekken."
#  subtitle3: "Computationeel denken"
#  subtitle3p1: "Het bouwen en het vormgeven van de robot passen zeer goed binnen de lessen techniek en plastische opvoeding."
#  subtitle3p2: "De verschillende modules zijn zo ontwikkeld dat ze goed aansluiten bij de nieuwe eindtermen voor de eerste graad secundair onderwijs, namelijk de transversale eindtermen digitale competentie en de eindtermen technologie."
#  subtitle3p3: "Binnen dit project werken de leerlingen met het Dwenguino microcontrollerplatform dat geïntegreerd is in de simulator."
#  subtitle3p4: "Tijdens het programmeer- en bouwproces komen verschillende aspecten van computationeel denken aan bod. Door grafisch te programmeren in de simulator hebben leerlingen op een laagdrempelige manier kennisgemaakt met de universele concepten van programmeren. Nadien kunnen ze gemakkelijk overschakelen naar andere programmeertalen."

  Artificial intelligence (AI) is extensively covered in the media. 
  Popular topics include chatbots, self-driving cars, virtual assistants, and job displacement. 
  AI systems are increasingly permeating our world.
  "
  paragraph2: "
  AI at School is a project that originated from the concern that students should understand artificial intelligence (AI) and the realization that there is a gap in the secondary education curriculum to address this. We create teaching materials for secondary education related to AI, aligned with the end goals and existing curriculum objectives.
  "

  AI at School is a project by dwengo vzw. 
  Within the project, we developed both the teaching materials and the necessary tools to work with machine learning and artificial intelligence in the classroom.
  All content that was available on aiopschool.be (<a href='/content/'>and much more</a>) is now available on dwengo.org."
  subtitle1: "AI"
  subtitle1p1: "AI is a branch within computer science. Providing a definition for AI, something used in so many different domains, is not an easy task. Within AI, knowledge-based and data-based systems are distinguished. The chatbot Eliza and the chess computer Deep Blue are examples of knowledge-based systems. The rules the computer follows are carefully programmed. Facial recognition is an example of a data-based system. This system has learned: based on the given data, it has adjusted the parameters in the programmed algorithm. This is also referred to as machine learning."
  subtitle2p2: "A distinction is made between general AI and narrow AI. General AI refers to computer systems with the same capabilities as a human being. Currently, we do not have the knowledge to design such systems. For now, AI is still at the level of narrow AI: AI systems that perform specific tasks for which they were designed."
  subtitle2: "At School"
  subtitle2p1: "As students surf the internet, post photos on Instagram, use Google Docs, have an email sent by a virtual assistant like Siri, or walk through the city, data is captured. What if an AI system correlates all that big data? Are these AI systems objective when making decisions? Should students leaving secondary education not have an understanding of our digitized world? Is this insight not necessary for them to make informed decisions in their adult lives? The 'AI at School' team believes it is. We create teaching materials for secondary education related to AI, aligned with the end goals and existing curriculum objectives. We believe that all young people should know and understand the fundamentals of AI. The best way to reach all young people is through school. Moreover, school is the ideal place to make students aware of the ethical aspects of AI systems."

We challenge the children to build and program a creative art robot that can draw independently. This way, they learn various STEM skills from technology to computational thinking."
  paragraph2: "On this page, we have gathered all supporting didactic material in an online lesson. WeGoSTEM bundles several interesting activities that you can realize in two class hours."  
  title: "Borrow the drawing robots for free in the library and bring STEM into the classroom"
  titlep1: "To facilitate the distribution of our material, we collaborate with local libraries. You can find an overview at the bottom of this page, with links to the reservation form or a contact person."
  titlep2: "With the material in this box, you can conduct a WeGoSTEM workshop for a class of up to 30 students. Get your colleagues excited about WeGoSTEM and give the workshop together for all students in the 5th and 6th grades!" 
  titlep3: "The material should be returned to the library after <strong>two weeks</strong>!"
  subtitle1: "Origin"
  subtitle1p1: "In 2017, during the jury presentations of Young ICT Lady of the Year candidates, 3 of the candidates started talking to each other. It quickly became clear that the reason for participating in SheGoesICT was the same: to share their passion by inspiring students for STEM. That same day, the 3 decided to set up an activity together. A first trial workshop, which was already composed by Dwengo vzw, took place in a school in Ghent on International Women's Day."
  subtitle1p2: "The trial workshop looked good, and we decided to turn it into a major initiative with the first focus: offering this workshop to thousands of children at school, during the EU Code Week in October. To achieve this, we combined the didactic knowledge and experience of Dwengo with the enthusiasm and network of the SheGoesICT candidates. Together, we trained 300 volunteers who, in groups of 3, wanted to teach a robot workshop for one day. We brought the necessary material to the schools and picked it up there again. With the help of subsidies and sponsorship from the industry, we were able to reach about 4000 children in this way."
  subtitle2: "Professionalization"
  subtitle2p1: "Organizing WeGoSTEM was very satisfying, and it quickly became clear that we wanted to make it an annual initiative. This required professionalization of the approach. From 2018 onwards, we mainly focused on our own website where volunteers and schools could register. This allowed us to automate the planning to a large extent. The WeGoSTEM kit also needed improvement. We learned from the feedback of the volunteers and adjusted the material."
  subtitle2p2: "We were able to expand our reach during the EU Code Week in 2018 and 2019, with more than 5000 and more than 7000 children, respectively. It became a great success! From 2018 onwards, we expanded to Wallonia in addition to Flanders and Brussels, and WeGoSTEM even took place in Greece. As in 2017, we focused on schools where, more than average, children with disadvantaged backgrounds attend. This way, we reached 30% of children with a disadvantaged background each time. We also continued to pay attention to a good gender balance, and we are proud that the volunteers are 40% female!"
  subtitle3: "COVID"
  subtitle3p1: "COVID forced us to think about a completely different approach. Going to schools with volunteers was not possible. That's why we decided to focus on a 'teach-the-teacher' principle. We developed an online learning path so that teachers could prepare themselves and give the workshop in class. We still brought the material to the schools. Each teacher got an online <em>buddy</em>, one of the more experienced volunteers from previous years. Instead of a pure focus on EU Code Week, we spread the initiative in 2020 over the entire school year 2020-2021."
  subtitle3p2: "We received positive feedback from the teachers, and the buddies told us that there were hardly any questions. The basis of the online learning path was good and was further improved."
  subtitle3p3: "From 2021 onwards, we decided not to return to the approach as before but to rethink the approach. We now work with a (more limited) version of WeGoSTEM during the EU Code Week, with an even stronger focus on disadvantaged children. During the rest of the school year, every school can now use the supporting didactic material and also borrow the robot material for free from one of the libraries with which we are setting up a collaboration. To make the material even more accessible, Dwengo has developed an online simulator that can be used on any computer or Chromebook. Schools can now work with their own laptops or Chromebooks."

project:
  page_title: "Computational Thinking"
  intro: "In our increasingly digitized world, it is important that everyone, in addition to reading, writing, and arithmetic, can also think computationally. Computational thinking is about the ability to solve problems using a computer."
  summary: "When you think computationally, you think about the steps needed to arrive at a solution to a specific problem, after which you set the computer to work on solving the problem using your technical knowledge."
  title1: "In the Classroom"

  intro: "In our increasingly digitized world, it is important that everyone, in addition to reading, writing, and arithmetic, can also think computationally. Computational thinking is about the ability to solve problems using a computer."
  summary: "When you think computationally, you think about the steps needed to arrive at a solution to a specific problem, after which you set the computer to work on solving the problem using your technical knowledge."

  subtitle1: "Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) are finding their way into our society, including hospitals. But innovations in the healthcare sector are not only on the hospital floor but also in general practitioner practices, in drug research, and at your home. Researchers develop applications of artificial intelligence for the healthcare sector. This is best done by <strong>interdisciplinary teams</strong> that anticipate possible negative effects and prioritize putting the <strong>patient at the center</strong>. Progress in hardware, e.g., sensors, and software, e.g., language technology, leads to new possibilities. Data-driven and rule-based AI models are combined into effective and more <strong>transparent systems</strong>. Thanks to wearables, patients can be monitored remotely, research on migraines is conducted through a smartphone app, anamnesis interviews are conducted via a chatbot, and AI assists radiologists in assessing medical images.<br><br>If these new technologies are developed, taking into account all users and possible societal effects, they have the potential to reduce the workload in the healthcare sector and provide better healthcare."

chatbot:
  intro_title: "Chatbot"
  paragraph1: "<strong>Where language and technology come together, the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) emerges. Using machine learning techniques, such as training models to recognize text, images, or sound frequencies, we can enable computers to intelligently work with language. Well-known NLP applications of machine learning include translation programs, voice control systems, or virtual assistants like Siri, and chat robots.</strong>"
  paragraph2: "We explore questions like <em>How can we automatically understand, translate, and even write texts?</em>, <em>Can a computer recognize emotions or irony in text?</em>, and especially <em>How important is data?</em>. Students in the second and third grades of secondary education gain insight into the NLP domain and take their first steps into the world of programming with Python."

  title: "Scientific Research"
  titlep1: "In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), researchers rely on algorithms to examine texts. They use both <strong>knowledge-based</strong> and <strong>data-based artificial intelligence</strong> for this purpose. Through sentiment analysis, for example, they can determine whether people express themselves positively or negatively about certain products, companies, or individuals on social media. Based on writing style, they try to identify who wrote a particular text. They also investigate how they can distinguish <strong>personality types</strong> based on language. A good knowledge of linguistics, computer science, and psychology is indispensable for this; NLP is an <strong>interdisciplinary</strong> field."
  titlep2: "Developments in language technology provide <strong>new tools</strong> to detect fake news, combat crime, and make healthcare more efficient; there are also numerous applications in the business world."
  titlep3: "This story also raises <strong>ethical questions</strong>. For research in language technology, data is used, such as messages on social media and chat messages. But what about privacy? Do we find it acceptable that someone's personality is examined based on the texts they write? Do we find it desirable how this knowledge is then applied? Researchers also grapple with these questions. Some, for example, develop algorithms that depersonalize texts."
  subtitle1: "AI"
  subtitle1p1: "To process natural language, artificial intelligence is used. Students explore natural language processing systems for applications such as sentiment analysis, cyberbullying detection, and author recognition. These systems do not deal with raw data; the texts are prepared before the computer analyzes them. Students gain insight into the principles of computational thinking, which are clearly illustrated here, such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithms. They learn about the possibilities and limitations of knowledge-based and data-based systems."
  subtitle2: "Chatbots"
  subtitle2p1: "More and more companies and organizations place a chatbot on their website with a view to better service. Thanks to NLP and considering user expectations, these automatic conversation partners are becoming increasingly pleasant to use. Chatbots are used for customer service, HR, providing information, and in various domains such as healthcare, entertainment, the business world, politics, and education. Students experience the limitations of a rule-based chatbot themselves, making them more media-savvy, as most chatbots in commercial applications today still primarily operate on a rule-based basis."
  subtitle3: "Sentiment Analysis"
  subtitle3p1: "The popularity of the internet not only led to the rise of social media but also gave rise to a new research domain: detecting feelings and opinions in texts. Sentiment analysis has already proven its importance for the business world, industry, and society. Automatically assigning a sentiment score to online customer reviews, tweets about politics, or a chatbot conversation, it all happens with artificial intelligence: NLP applied in both a knowledge-based (using rules) and data-based (using machine learning) manner."

  project_2_description: "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a prominent topic in the media. Popular themes include chatbots, self-driving cars, virtual assistants, and job loss. AI systems are increasingly penetrating our world. AI in School is a project that originated from the concern that students should understand artificial intelligence (AI) and the realization that there is a gap in the curriculum of secondary education to address this. We create educational material for secondary education related to AI, linked to the final objectives and existing curriculum goals. All this educational material is available on our website."

  project_4_description: "Building a robot with students or introducing another application of physical computing in the classroom is not so simple. To make it as accessible as possible for teachers, Dwengo developed its own microcontroller platform, Dwenguino, and a graphical programming environment, DwenguinoBlockly. Even without physical material, you can work with it. Dwenguino is an Arduino-based microcontroller platform that contains many elements for quickly building your own device, such as a social robot, weather station, musical instrument, or autonomous car. Dwenguino has buttons, an LCD screen, a buzzer, LEDs, and connectors to connect motors. Dwenguino is open source. The platform is currently used for students from 10 years old to higher education. A curriculum can be built from the first to the third grade of secondary education, from graphical to textual programming, and with an increasing level of difficulty in applications."

  project_5_description: "Problems are often easier, more accurate, and faster to solve with the help of a computer. When you think computationally, you think about the steps needed to solve a particular problem, then use your technical knowledge to set the computer to work through those steps and solve the problem. Computational thinking strongly focuses on problem-solving skills and can be addressed in any subject in regular education. Many concepts of computational thinking can be practically approached in programming lessons. However, you can also learn a lot about computational thinking without a computer. Dwengo helps teachers with plugged and unplugged activities to teach their students computational thinking and aims to make teachers proficient in recognizing the concepts of computational thinking in their own teaching materials. Plugged activities focus on physical computing (with graphical and textual programming) and STEM (with Python)."

  page_title: Wedstrijd 'sociale robot'
  intro: "In het dagelijkse leven kom je steeds vaker in contact met robots in allerlei vormen en maten. Toch verloopt de communicatie met deze robots vaak behoorlijk stroef! Wij hebben jou nodig om daar verandering in te brengen!"
  summary: "Ga je de uitdaging aan? Schrijf je dan in voor onze 'sociale robot'-wedstrijd! Ontwerp, bouw en programmeer in een team van maximaal vier personen een sociale robot die kan dienen als oplossing voor een maatschappelijk probleem."
  title1: De wedstrijd
  t1p1: "Dit schooljaar organiseert Dwengo de eerste editie van haar ‘sociale robot’-wedstrijd. Voor deze wedstrijd ontwerp en bouw jij, in groepjes van maximaal vier personen, een sociale robot die een oplossing biedt voor een maatschappelijk probleem. 

Om deel te nemen stuur je voor 1 december 2024 een eerste keer een technische fiche naar Dwengo. Nadien maak je een filmpje waarin je jouw robot voorstelt en uitlegt welk maatschappelijk probleem deze oplost. Dit stuur je, samen met een gefinaliseerde technische fiche van je robot, door naar Dwengo voor …... De twintig beste inzendingen worden uitgenodigd voor de finale op 7 mei 2025. Daar zal je jouw robot moeten voorstellen aan een professionele jury die de beste 3 robots selecteert.

Het is de bedoeling om met beperkte middelen het gekozen maatschappelijk probleem zo goed mogelijk aan te pakken. Om hun beoordeling te maken zal de jury zowel met het gekozen maatschappelijk probleem, de oplossing ervan en de technische uitwerking rekening houden.
"
  title2: Doelgroep
  t2p1: "De wedstrijd richt zich op leerlingen van de eerste en tweede graad van het secundair onderwijs. Zij kunnen in groepjes van maximaal vier leerlingen deelnemen aan de wedstrijd. Zowel het sociale als het technische aspect van je robot worden opgenomen in de eindbeoordeling. Het kan dus nuttig zijn om deel te nemen met een team van leerlingen uit verschillende studierichtingen (weliswaar van dezelfde graad). Zo kunnen jullie elkaars competenties versterken!

De inschrijving voor de wedstrijd verloopt via de school. Heb je interesse om deel te nemen? Stel een team samen en overtuig jullie leerkracht om jullie team in te schrijven!
"
  title3: Waarom moet ik meedoen?
  t3p1: "Vandaag de dag zijn computers in allerlei vormen (domotica, huishoudelijke apparatuur, robots, ...) niet meer weg te denken uit onze samenleving. Het is dus niet enkel belangrijk dat je deze technologieën leert gebruiken, maar ook dat je je verdiept in de onderliggende fundamentele concepten.  Door mee te doen aan onze robotcompetitie maak je op een leuke manier kennis met de verschillende technische aspecten van robotica. Bovendien doe je zowel computationele als sociale vaardigheden op door in teamverband aan een open probleem te werken.
Deelname aan de wedstrijd is gratis. Jouw leerkracht kan de nodige elektronica ontlenen via de onderwijskoepel van je school. Het materiaal voor de bouw van het lichaam van de robot voorzie je zelf. Je kan hier je creativiteit dus de vrije loop laten."
  title4: "Ik doe mee! En nu?"
  t4p1: "Je kan enkel deelnemen via jouw school. Je zal dus een van je leerkrachten moeten overtuigen om jouw team in te schrijven en te begeleiden bij het ontwerpen en bouwen van je robot. Vraag je leerkracht eerst en vooral om de nodige elektronica te reserveren. Dat kan via <a href='https://forms.gle/NfnD6d1xLE8EPY678'>deze link</a>.

Heb je je leerkracht kunnen overtuigen? Bekijk dan al eens het lesmateriaal over de sociale robot op: <a href='https://dwengo.org/socialerobot'>dwengo.org/socialrobot</a>. Hier vind je alle informatie die je nodig hebt om je robot te ontwerpen en te bouwen."
